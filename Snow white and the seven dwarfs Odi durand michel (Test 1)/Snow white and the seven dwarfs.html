    <p class="auto-style6">
      At the beginning of the story, a beautiful young queen sits sewing at an
      open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her
      needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen
      white snow on the black windowsill. Admiring the beauty of the resulting
      color combination, she says to herself, "How I wish that I had a daughter
      that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as
      ebony." Some time later, the Good Queen gives birth to a baby daughter
      whom she names Snow White. Sadly, the Good Queen dies shortly after her
      daughter is born.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      A year later, Snow White's father, the King, takes a second wife, who is
      very beautiful, but a wicked and vain woman. The new queen, Snow White's
      evil stepmother, possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning,
      "Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?" The mirror
      always replies: "My Queen, you are the fairest one of all." The Queen is
      always pleased with that, because the magic mirror never lies. But as Snow
      White grows up, she becomes more beautiful each day and even more
      beautiful than the Queen, and when the Queen asks her mirror, it says; "My
      Queen, you are the fairest here so true. But Snow White is a thousand
      times more beautiful than you."
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that
      moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, and the Queen hates the
      girl more and more. Eventually, the angry Queen orders a huntsman to take
      Snow White into the deepest woods to be killed. As proof that Snow White
      is dead, the Queen demands that he returns with her lungs and liver. The
      huntsman takes Snow White into the forest. After raising his knife, he
      finds himself unable to kill her, and he spares her life. He instead
      brings the Queen the heart of a wild animal.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      After wandering through the forest, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage
      belonging to a group of Seven Dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats
      some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine and then tests all the
      beds. Finally the last bed is comfortable enough for her and she falls
      asleep. When the seven dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware
      that someone snuck in secretly, because everything in their home is in
      disorder. During their loud discussion about who snuck in, they discover
      the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened,
      and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for
      housekeeping. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no
      one in when they are away delving in the mountains.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      Meanwhile, the Queen asks her mirror once again: "Magic mirror in my hand,
      who is the fairest in the land?" The mirror replies: "My queen, you are
      the fairest here so true. But Snow White beyond the mountains at the seven
      dwarfs is a thousand times more beautiful than you". The Queen is
      horrified to learn that the huntsman has betrayed her and that Snow White
      is still alive. She keeps thinking about how to get rid of Snow White,
      then she disguises herself as an old peddler. The Queen then walks to the
      cottage of the dwarfs and offers her colorful, silky laced bodices and
      convinces Snow White to take the most beautiful laces as a present. Then
      the Queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints, causing the
      Queen to leave her for dead. But the dwarfs return just in time, and Snow
      White revives when the dwarfs loosen the laces.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      The Queen then consults her mirror again, and the mirror reveals Snow
      White's survival. Now infuriated, the Queen dresses as a comb seller and
      convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present. She brushes
      Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb, and the girl faints again, but
      she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her
      hair. And the mirror tells the Queen that Snow White is still "a thousand
      times more beautiful". As a third and final attempt to rid herself of Snow
      White, the Queen secretly consults the darkest magic and makes a poisoned
      apple, and in the disguise of a farmer's wife, she offers it to Snow
      White. The girl is at first hesitant to accept it, so the Queen cuts the
      apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red
      (poisoned) half to Snow White. The girl eagerly takes a bite and falls
      into a state of suspended animation. This time the dwarfs are unable to
      revive Snow White, and assuming that she is dead, they place her in a
      glass casket.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      After a short period of time, a prince traveling through the land sees
      Snow White. He strides to her coffin and, enchanted by her beauty,
      instantly falls in love with her. The dwarfs succumb to his entreaties to
      let him have Snow White. The moment he lifts the coffin to carry it away,
      the piece of poisoned apple falls from between her lips, and Snow White
      awakens, saying, "Where am I?" The Prince then declares his love for her,
      and soon a wedding is planned. Snow White and the Prince invite everyone
      to come to their wedding party, including Snow White's stepmother.
      Meanwhile, the Queen, still believing that Snow White is dead, again asks
      her magical mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says: "Thou,
      lady, art loveliest here, I ween; But lovelier far is the new-made Queen"
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style6">
      Appalled, in disbelief, and enraged, she decides to go. Not knowing that
      the Prince's bride was indeed her stepdaughter, she arrives at the
      wedding, and sees that the bride is Snow White, who she thought long dead.
      She chokes with rage, falls down, and dies. But Snow White and the prince
      lived and reigned happily over the land for many, many years; and
      sometimes they went up into the mountains and visited the dwarfs, who had
      been so kind to Snow White.
